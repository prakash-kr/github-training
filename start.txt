1. Learnt the first command to clone a repository
	git clone <repository-path>
	
2. To check the status of the repository
	git status
	Lists the untracked, tracked and committed changes on the current branch
	eg, 
	$ git status
		On branch main
		Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

		nothing to commit, working tree clean
		
3. To create a file from git bash 
	echo "content in double quotes" >> <filename>
	eg, 
	$ echo "Learnt the first command to clone a repository" >> start.txt

4. to read the content of a file
	cat <filename>
	eg,
	$ cat start.txt

5. Conceptually, there are 4 memory areas, 
	                                  Local											   			| 				Remote
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Working Directory 		| 		Staging Area 			| 		  Repository(.git folder)		| Remote host like GitHub
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Holds the 		  		|Holds the changes to be 		|Holds the committed changes			|Final place where the codes pushed from local repository resides
untracked files			|committed using add command	|that are ready to be pushed			|ready for collaboration
eg,						|eg,							|eg,									|eg,
Newly created/modified	|git add start.txt				|git commit -m "Adding start text file"	|$ git push origin main
files					|								|										|

6. When we have changes in the working directory, a git status would look like
	$ git status
	On branch main
	Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

	Untracked files:
	  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
			start.txt

	nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

7. When we have changes in the Staging Area, a git status would look like
	$ git status
	On branch main
	Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

	Changes to be committed:
	  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
			new file:   start.txt
			
8. When we have changes committed to the Local Repository, a git status would look like
	$ git status
	On branch main
	Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
	  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

	nothing to commit, working tree clean
